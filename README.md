# Introduction-to-computer-science
# C Programming Exams â€“ Introductory Course

This repository contains three projects written in C as part of exams in my introductory programming course. Each project focuses on a different fundamental data structure or concept in C.

## ðŸŸ¦ Tic-Tac-Toe (Arrays)

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

- **Purpose**: Assess understanding of 2D arrays.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Board representation using a 2D array
  - Input validation and turn handling
  - Win and tie detection logic
- **Notes**: The game supports two human players and checks for a winner or a tie after every move.

## ðŸ“’ Telephone Book (Linked List)

This project implements a simple telephone book using a singly linked list with memory allocation.

- **Purpose**: Practice dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Add, search, and delete contacts by name
  - Traverse and display all saved contacts
  - Memory is allocated and freed properly
- **Notes**: The project showcases basic linked list operations and safe input handling.

## ðŸŒ³ Binary Tree (Tree Data Structure)

This project involves implementing a binary tree and performing various operations on it.

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate understanding of recursive structures and tree traversal.
- **Key Features**:
  - Insertion of nodes into a binary search tree (BST)
  - In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals
  - Search functionality within the tree
- **Notes**: The implementation uses recursion extensively and emphasizes clean structure and logical flow.
